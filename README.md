User request for SOMU, it has a new function "Blunder Check" for PGN games without comments.

Unzip preferable in C:\ for best visual and start the tool by double clicking the SOMU or START shortcut. Thereafter press [F5] and follow the instructions.

SOMU uses Sfockfish 15 as analysis engine, Stockfish is GPL and can be found at - https://stockfishchess.org/

TO-DO - Make the "Blunder Check" function available for general use.
